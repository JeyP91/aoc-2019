== Day 10

Only a short documentation this time.
The puzzle was really hard to solve for me and it is already late.

First of all I wrote some helper methods to convert the given map into a set of asteroids.

And to handle the line of sight.

=== First Star

With this set up, solving the first star war as simple as iterating over all asteroids, calculating the line of sight and check if it is obstructed.

=== Second Star

The second star nearly crushed me, until I checked Michael Simons solution (thanks!)
This pointed me to the atan2 function, which is required to sort the asteroids clockwise.
