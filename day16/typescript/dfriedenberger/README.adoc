== Flawed Frequency Transmission

The solutions are written in Typescript. To run them use the following commands.

....
npm install
gulp
node dist/solution1.js
node dist/solution2.js
....

=== First Star

Implementing algorithm for calulate next sequence straight forward.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Calculator.ts[tag=next]
....

And run it 100 times for given input data.
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution1.ts[]
....
=== Second Star

When I started algorithm with input repeated 10000 times I quickly realized that the runtime complexity is O(n^2^) with a real runtime over an hour only called once. Found out that the last numbers only are sum of successors. So implemented optimized algorithm with runtime complexity O(n)
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/Calculator.ts[tag=nextOptimized]
....

This I could run 100 times in short time. A good example for showing difference between runtime complexity O(n) and O(n^2^)
[source, typescript, numbered]
....
include::src/solution2.ts[]
