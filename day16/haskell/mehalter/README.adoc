== Sensor Boost

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

My solution for part 1 is the trivial solution of applying the pattern to the
input for 100 iterations and then return the first 8 characters

Part 2 was tricky because of the large input overflowing the stack and taking
forever trying to run the FFT algorithm on the input repeated 10,000 times.
To optimize this, you have to realize the fact that the offset is over half the
list, and therefore you are only adding numbers with the pattern and never
multiplying by 0 or -1. So you can keep track of a cumulative summation of the
rest of the digits after the offset.
