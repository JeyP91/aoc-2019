== Flawed Frequency Transmission

=== Part 1

I got to the first part in about an hour

=== Part 2

After seeing that we now have input of 650 characters that has to be repeated 10000 times to be the input signal I realized that
42 249 993 500 000 calculations for a single phase is going to be a problem.

It looks like the name FFT is the hint because there are parts of Fast fourier transform that uses a technique called Chinese number
theorem to reduce the number of calculations.

I just need to figure out how it works.
