== Set and Forget

To run the final program you need Haskell installed, and simply run the
`./run.sh`.

I took a simple bruteforce solution for Part 1 of collecting the points
from the Intcode computer, and searching for points were character '#'
and were also surrounded by '#'s.

For Part 2 for speed, I printed the map and manually found the ideal path
since the output was simple enough to parse easily by hand. I included the way I
went from the path to the solution as comments in `answer.hs`, as well as a copy
of the outputted map as `map.txt`
