=== Part 1
After spending half a day trying to get it working with the wrong input file, I eventually realized I need to just walk the maze with a
simple strategy to discover the structure and then use a Graph shortest path algorithm to solve.

I found a reasonable implementation of Dijkstra's algoritm at http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#Kotlin
I made if Generic so now I can reuse as I need.

Run with `-p` to see the robot walk the maze.
